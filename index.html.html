             <font color="white">What if BUGATTI developed a radically light, completely new concept around its iconic 8.0-liter W16 engine?<br>

              
                 The answer: the BUGATTI Bolide<br>The Bugatti Bolide is a track-day-focused sportscar developed by Bugatti Engineering in Wolfsburg, Germany and manufactured in Molsheim, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., revealed online on October 28, 2020. According to Bugatti, the concept version of the Bolide is using the W16 engine with a weight-to-power-ratio of 0.91 kg/kW. Bugatti announced the Bolide would be the last car ever made with their W16 engine. The Bolide's name comes from the term le bolide, which literally means "the racing car" in French. The fundamental concept of the Bolide is based on a technical draft of Bugatti chief engineer and "Technical Guru" Frank Goetzke.In April 2023, Bugatti revealed the production version of the Bolide as a track-only hypercar.The Bolide is built using the framework of the same 8-liter quad-turbo W16 engine and the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission used in the Chiron, although upgrades to the W16 engine allow the Bolide to generate over 1,360 kW (1,824 hp; 1,849 PS) and 1,850 N·m (1,364 lb·ft) of torque, 207 kW (277 hp; 281 PS), more than the Chiron Super Sport 300+. This increase in power can be attributed to bigger blades in the turbochargers and the different orientation of the turbochargers themselves. Combining the fact that the curb weight of the car is only 1,240 kg (2,733.7 lb), the Bolide can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.2 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 4.4 seconds, 0–299 km/h (186 mph) in 7.4 seconds, 0–401 km/h (249 mph) in 12.1 seconds, and 0–501 km/h (311 mph) in 20.1 seconds and a top speed projected of more than 501 km/h (311 mph). Additionally, Bugatti states that the Bolide has a 0–401–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) of 24.62 seconds, and a 0–501–0 km/h (0–311–0 mph) time of 33.62 seconds. According to Bugatti, computer simulations show that the Bolide could lap the Nürburgring in 5 minutes and 23.1 seconds, making it just four seconds slower than the current record holder, the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo. The Bolide is also simulated to have a lap time at the Circuit de la Sarthe of just 3 minutes and 7.1 seconds, making it 7.6 seconds quicker than the current record holder, the Toyota TS050, which lapped the circuit in 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds.The main influence on the Bolide's light curb weight is due to the monocoque and all of its components constructed with titanium, along with nearly all of the body panels constructed in carbon fiber. Donning the aggressive design language of an LMP1 racecar (specifically the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept, which previewed the Bolide), including the signature X-shape (itself inspired by the Bell X-1 aircraft), the aerodynamics of the Bolide help it generate more than 2,630 kg (5,800 lb) of downforce at 320 km/h (200 mph), with 1,810 kg (4,000 lb) at the rear wing and another 820 kg (1,800 lb) at the front wing. Additionally, the air scoop of the Bolide is home to a group of dimples, similar to what one finds in a golf ball, that raise up at high speeds, smoothing the laminar flow of air and reducing the aerodynamic drag of the scoop by 10% and a reduction in lift forces by 17%, according to Bugatti. The height of the Bolide, 100 cm (39.2 in), matches the height of the famous Bugatti Le Mans racecar, the Bugatti Type 57C, on which much of the Bolide harkens to.In August 2021, Bugatti announced at The Quail, A Motorsport Gathering in California that the production Bolide has its first delivery scheduled for 2024 at a net unit price of €4 million and limited to 40 units. Although the concept version boasted a power output of 1,361 kW (1,825 hp; 1,850 PS), this was achieved using 110-octane racing fuel. The production version will have a power output of 1,177 kW (1,578 hp; 1,600 PS) with a torque figure of 1,600 N·m (1,180 lbf·ft) at 2,250 rpm using 98 RON gas. The production version will weigh in at 1,450 kg (3,197 lb) and therefore will have a weight-to-power ratio of 1.2 kg/kW (0.9 kg/PS; 2.0 lb/hp) when 98 RON gas is used.
